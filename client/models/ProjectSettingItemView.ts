    * Flag that indicates whether someone enabled the regionalized private endpoint setting for the specified project.  - Set this value to `true` to enable regionalized private endpoints. This allows you to create more than one private endpoint in a cloud provider region. You need to enable this setting to connect to multi-region and global MongoDB Cloud sharded clusters. Enabling regionalized private endpoints introduces the following limitations:   - Your applications must use the new connection strings for existing multi-region and global sharded clusters. This might cause downtime.   - Your MongoDB Cloud project can't contain replica sets nor can you create new replica sets in this project.    - You can't disable this setting if you have:     - more than one private endpoint in more than one region     - more than one private endpoint in one region and one private endpoint in one or more regions.  - Set this value to `false` to disable regionalized private endpoints.
