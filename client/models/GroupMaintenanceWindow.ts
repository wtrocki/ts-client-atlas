/**
 * MongoDB Atlas Administration API
 * The MongoDB Atlas Administration API allows developers to manage all components in MongoDB Atlas.  The Atlas Administration API uses HTTP Digest Authentication to authenticate requests. Provide a programmatic API public key and corresponding private key as the username and password when constructing the HTTP request. For example, to [return database access history](#tag/Access-Tracking/operation/listAccessLogsByClusterName) with [cURL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CURL), run the following command in the terminal:  ``` curl --user \"{PUBLIC-KEY}:{PRIVATE-KEY}\" \\   --digest \\   --header \"Accept: application/vnd.atlas.2023-02-01+json\" \\   GET \"https://cloud.mongodb.com/api/atlas/v2/groups/{groupId}/dbAccessHistory/clusters/{clusterName}?pretty=true\" ```  To learn more, see [Get Started with the Atlas Administration API](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/configure-api-access/). For support, see [MongoDB Support](https://www.mongodb.com/support/get-started).
